This project, developed on the ServiceNow Personal Developer Instance (PDI), focuses on automating and optimizing the support ticket assignment process to improve operational efficiency and reduce manual workload in IT service management (ITSM).

üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design a comprehensive and secure support management system that automatically routes support tickets to the appropriate teams based on issue type. This ensures faster response times, consistent workflows, and better transparency across operations.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

Custom Ticket Table:
Designed a dedicated table (Operations related) to manage support tickets and link them with users, roles, and groups.

Access Control (ACLs):
Implemented robust ACL rules to protect data and ensure secure access for different user roles.

Automated Ticket Assignment:
Built intelligent Flows in ServiceNow‚Äôs Flow Designer to auto-assign tickets to specific groups based on issue type (e.g., login issues ‚Üí Platform Group, certificate issues ‚Üí Certificate Group).

End-to-End Automation:
Automated ticket creation, routing, and closure to reduce delays and manual intervention.
